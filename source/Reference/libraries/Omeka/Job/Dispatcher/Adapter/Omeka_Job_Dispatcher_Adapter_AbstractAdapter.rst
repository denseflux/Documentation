.. php:namespace:

.. php:class:: Omeka_Job_Dispatcher_Adapter_AbstractAdapter

    Abstract class for job dispatcher adapters.

    .. php:method:: __construct($options = null)

        :type $options: array|null
        :param $options: Optional Options to instantiate in the adapter.

    .. php:method:: _setOptions($options)

        :param $options:

    .. php:method:: getOption($name)

        Retrieve an option by name as it was passed to the constructor of the
        adapter.

        :type $name: string
        :param $name:

    .. php:method:: hasOption($name)

        Whether or not the given option has been set.

        :type $name: string
        :param $name:

    .. php:method:: setQueueName($name)

        Adapter implementations do not understand named queues by default, so
        this default implementation returns false.  Override this in subclasses
        to specify the correct behavior.

        :param $name:

    .. php:method:: send($encodedJob, $metadata)

        Send the job to whatever underlying system is used by the adapter.

        :type $encodedJob: string
        :param $encodedJob: The job encoded as a string.  In most cases, this will be passed directly into whatever client or queue the adapter uses.
        :type $metadata: array
        :param $metadata: An array containing all the metadata for the job. This is the unencoded version of the first argument and exists as a convenience so that adapter writers do not have to attempt to decode the first argument manually. This array contains the following keys: <ul> <li>className - Corresponds to the class name of the job.</li> <li>options - Options that are passed to the job when it is instantiated.</li> <li>createdBy - User object (or null) corresponding to the user who created this job.</li> <li>createdAt - Zend_Date corresponding to the date/time at which this job was created.</li> </ul>
